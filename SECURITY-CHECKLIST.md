# ðŸ”’ Pixscaler Security Checklist

## Pre-Production Deployment

### âœ… Environment Variables
- [ ] **JWT_SECRET** is set to a secure random string (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] **SESSION_SECRET** is set to a secure random string (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] **NODE_ENV** is set to 'production'
- [ ] **CORS_ORIGINS** is set to your actual domain(s)
- [ ] All API keys and secrets are stored securely (not in code)

### âœ… Database Security
- [ ] Database file path points to a secure location
- [ ] Database file has proper file permissions (600 or 640)
- [ ] Regular database backups are configured
- [ ] Test data is cleared from production database

### âœ… Server Configuration
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled with valid SSL certificates
- [ ] Firewall is configured to block unnecessary ports
- [ ] Server logs are configured and monitored
- [ ] Rate limiting is properly configured
- [ ] File upload limits are appropriate for your use case

### âœ… Code Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or passwords in source code
- [ ] Input validation is enabled on all endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection protection is in place (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS protection is enabled (CSP headers)
- [ ] Authentication middleware is properly configured

### âœ… Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Error logging is comprehensive
- [ ] Security events are logged
- [ ] Log rotation is configured
- [ ] Monitoring alerts are set up

## Security Best Practices

### Generate Secure Secrets
Use one of these methods to generate secure random strings:

**Node.js:**
```javascript
require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex')
```

**OpenSSL:**
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

**Online Generator:**

### Recommended Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy example environment file
cp env.example .env

# Edit with your secure values
nano .env

# Set proper permissions
chmod 600 .env
```

### Database Backup Strategy
```bash
# Create backup directory
mkdir -p /secure/backups/pixscaler

# Automated backup script (add to cron)
sqlite3 ./database/pixscaler.db ".backup /secure/backups/pixscaler/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).db"
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### âœ… Security Headers
Check that your site returns proper security headers:
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-XSS-Protection

### âœ… SSL Configuration
Verify HTTPS is working properly:
- SSL certificate is valid
- HTTP redirects to HTTPS
- HSTS header is present

### âœ… Authentication Testing
- Test login/logout functionality
- Verify JWT tokens are working
- Check rate limiting is active
- Test with invalid credentials

## Emergency Procedures

### Security Incident Response
1. **Immediate:** Disable the affected service if necessary
2. **Assess:** Determine the scope and impact
3. **Contain:** Prevent further damage
4. **Document:** Log all actions taken
5. **Recover:** Restore service safely
6. **Learn:** Update security measures

### Credential Compromise
If any secrets are compromised:
1. Immediately rotate all affected credentials
2. Revoke all existing JWT tokens
3. Monitor for suspicious activity
4. Update this checklist with lessons learned

**Remember:** Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regular reviews and updates are essential.
