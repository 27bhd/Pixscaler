## ðŸ›  Security Configuration Commands

### Generate Secure Secrets
Use one of these methods to generate secure random strings:

**Node.js (Recommended):**
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

**OpenSSL:**
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
[System.Web.Security.Membership]::GeneratePassword(32, 8)
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy example environment file
cp env.example .env

# Edit with your secure values (use secure editor)
nano .env

# Set proper permissions (Unix/Linux)
chmod 600 .env
```

### Database Backup Strategy
```bash
# Create backup directory
mkdir -p ./backups

# Manual backup
sqlite3 ./database/pixscaler.db ".backup ./backups/pixscaler-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).db"

# Automated backup script (add to cron)
*/6 * * * * /usr/bin/sqlite3 /path/to/database/pixscaler.db ".backup /secure/backups/pixscaler/backup-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d-\%H\%M\%S).db"
```

## ðŸ§ª Post-Deployment Verification

### âœ… Security Headers Test
Check that your site returns proper security headers:

```bash
curl -I https://yourdomain.com
```

Expected headers:
- `Content-Security-Policy`
- `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`

### âœ… SSL Configuration Test
Verify HTTPS is working properly:
- [ ] Visit https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/
- [ ] Enter your domain and check for A+ rating
- [ ] Verify HTTP redirects to HTTPS
- [ ] Check certificate validity and expiration

### âœ… Authentication & API Testing
- [ ] Test user registration with valid email
- [ ] Test login/logout functionality
- [ ] Verify JWT tokens are working correctly
- [ ] Test rate limiting is active (try multiple requests)
- [ ] Test with invalid credentials (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Verify file upload limits are enforced

### âœ… Performance Testing
- [ ] Test page load speed (aim for <3 seconds)
- [ ] Test image processing performance
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test with slow network conditions
- [ ] Check memory usage under load

### âœ… SEO Verification
- [ ] Test meta tags with social media preview tools
- [ ] Verify structured data with Google Rich Results Test
- [ ] Check robots.txt accessibility
- [ ] Test sitemap.xml (if created)
- [ ] Verify canonical URLs are correct

## ðŸš¨ Emergency Procedures

### Security Incident Response
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disable the affected service if necessary
   - Change all potentially compromised credentials
   - Enable additional logging
   - Document the incident timeline

2. **Assessment:**
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Identify attack vectors
   - Check for data breaches
   - Analyze log files

3. **Containment:**
   - Block malicious IPs if identified
   - Implement temporary security measures
   - Prevent further damage
   - Isolate affected systems

4. **Recovery:**
   - Restore from clean backups if needed
   - Apply security patches
   - Update security configurations
   - Monitor for continued attacks

5. **Post-Incident:**
   - Update security measures
   - Improve monitoring
   - Update this checklist
   - Consider security audit

### Credential Compromise Response
If any secrets are compromised:
1. **Immediately rotate all affected credentials**
2. **Force logout all users** (revoke all JWT tokens)
3. **Monitor logs for suspicious activity**
4. **Update security measures**
5. **Notify users if necessary**
6. **Document lessons learned**

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily Checks
- [ ] Monitor error logs for unusual activity
- [ ] Check site uptime and performance
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate status
- [ ] Monitor database size and performance

### Weekly Checks
- [ ] Review security logs
- [ ] Check for dependency updates
- [ ] Backup database
- [ ] Monitor resource usage

### Monthly Checks
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Update dependencies and security patches
- [ ] Review and rotate API keys
- [ ] Analyze performance metrics
- [ ] Review and update documentation

### Automated Monitoring Setup
Consider implementing:
- Uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
- Error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket)
- Performance monitoring (New Relic, DataDog)
- Security scanning (Snyk, OWASP ZAP)

## ðŸŽ¯ Production Deployment Checklist Summary

**Before deploying:**
1. âœ… Set all required environment variables
2. âœ… Test in staging environment
3. âœ… Configure domain and SSL
4. âœ… Set up monitoring and backups
5. âœ… Verify security configurations

**After deploying:**
1. âœ… Test all functionality
2. âœ… Verify security headers
3. âœ… Check SSL rating
4. âœ… Monitor for errors
5. âœ… Set up ongoing maintenance

**Remember:** Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regular reviews, updates, and monitoring are essential for maintaining a secure production environment.
